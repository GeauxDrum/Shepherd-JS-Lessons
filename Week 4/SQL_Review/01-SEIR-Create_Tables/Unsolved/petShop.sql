-- Show databases we already have


-- Create a new database called pet_shop


-- If you need to delete a previous version of the db
-- IF EXISTS prevents an error if it does NOT exist


-- Specify the database we want to use


-- Create a new table called customers and provide appropriate fields
-- Include a pet_age field with INT as its input but discuss why this
-- would be a bad idea for a real business


-- Let's take a look at our newly created table


-- Query all fields from the table
